Iâ€™m a biologist studying the ecology of aquatic systems and extreme environments. My work focuses on microbial communities, the metabolites they produce and their environmental effects. My current research also includes microorganism-mineral interactions, paying special attention to metals and nanometals. My aim is deciphering ecological processes to make predictions of overall changes in ecosystem services.
